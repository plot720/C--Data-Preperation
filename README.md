# C# Data Preperation

This project is currently a work in progress. The project contains various functions for preparing text data for use in algorithms. These methods include methods that Tokenize the text, get the count of each word in text, add beggining and end tokens to each sentence, remove infrequent words, and map words to integer values.

In the future other methods will be added to prepare other types of data as well as more methods to prepare text data. Methods for this project will be added as they come up in other projects that I work on so there really isn't a time table for this project.
